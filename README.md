# hello-world
I was born and grew up in the Lviv region near the western border of Ukraine. Due to this, I am fluent in Polish and have a good understanding of the Czech language.
I graduated from the University of International Trade in Kyiv and received a master's degree in "management of foreign economic activity".
I would describe myself as someone with analytical and strategic thinking. In addition, I think that good planning is the key to success in many matters. 
All my life I have been working in the B2B market. I like this field of activity. Furthermore, I do it pretty well.

I have currently employed in "Gant.UA" company as the B2B sales department chief. 
My main responsibilities are:
- CRM-system (Bitrix24) administration, control of office workers;
- key participation in the project of implementation of the 1C-8.3 program (preparation of technical tasks on new blocks and functionality of the program, settings, testing);
- training, coordination, and control of employees;
